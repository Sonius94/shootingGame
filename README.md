# Smartphone Game - shoot em all

This is a iOS-Game. You have a character on one side. From the other side of the phones characters start to run into the game. With a touch on the screen you can shoot into the direction you touched. If you hit the enemy, he will die. If an enemy is able to run onto the other side of the screen, you loose. The more enemies you hit that higher will be your score. The score is saved on phone even if you close the app.

# Just colors as characters

Normally I would use pictures for background, player, enemy and projectile. I didnt have creative commons that I could use right now (if you have something that could fit I would be happy). So I am using just colored blocks right now. The functionality will be the same.

# Upcoming features

- Change between different worlds. Change player/enemies/background and projectiles
- Add Background music. Logically turns off then you hear music with spotify etc.
- Change difficulty. Have not just an easy mode. Play with enemies who get harder over time.
- Adding in app purchases
