# Smartphone Game - shoot em all

This is a iOS-Game. You have a character on one side. From the other side of the phones characters start to run into the game. With a touch on the screen you can shoot into the direction you touched. If you hit the enemy, he will die. If an enemy is able to run onto the other side of the screen, you loose. The more enemies you hit that higher will be your score. The score is saved on phone even if you close the app.
